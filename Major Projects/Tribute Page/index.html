      <h2>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</h2>
      <p>When Eddie, a wounded war veteran whose job is to fix rides at an amusement park, dies as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart, he discovers the real meaning of his life. He always assumed his life story was boring, bland, and uninspired. But when he gets to Heaven, he finds that it's a place where you meet five people—some strangers, some not—whose lives intertwined with your own. Eddie learns that in his acts of kindness, he truly created a ripple effect and changed many lives over the course of his 83 years. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a lovely little novel to remind us all that we touch lives all the time, whether we notice or not.</p>

      <h2>The Time Keeper</h2>
      <p>Father Time is the first man on Earth who counted the hours. He invented the world's first clock, and as punishment for trying to measure God's gift, he is banished to a cave. He's there for centuries, listening to withered voices who come to him asking for more time. It nearly breaks him. When he's set free, into a world ironically dependent on his time-keeping, he has to teach two people the true meaning of time: a teenage girl who's about to give up on life and a wealthy businessman who wants to live forever. The Time Keeper is an inspirational Mitch Albom novel to get readers thinking about their time on earth and how to best spend it.</p>

      <h2>Have a Little Faith</h2>
      <p>In his first nonfiction book since Tuesdays with Morrie, Mitch Albom shares the story of his eight-year journey between two worlds and two faiths. When an 82-year-old rabbi from Albom's hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy, he sets out to get to know the man better. At the time, he's also involved with a Christian pastor—a reformed drug dealer and convict—who preaches to the poor and homeless in a church that's falling apart. Albom bounces between these two worlds and finds they're not so different after all. In Have a Little Faith, Albom explores the ways men work through life with the help of faith, and how we all need to believe in something bigger than ourselves in order to survive.</p>
